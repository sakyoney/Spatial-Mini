# Spatial-Mini
Spatial Transcriptomic Mini Project

## Data download
- GEO accession: **GSE274103**
- Platform: 10x Genomics Visium
- Tissue: Treatment-naive PDAC
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE274103

## Analysis overview
1. Visium data loading and spatial coordinate reconstruction
2. Quality control, normalization, and clustering (Scanpy)
3. Spatial neighbor graph construction (Squidpy)
4. Neighborhood enrichment analysis
5. Marker gene identification and biological interpretation

## Key findings
- Identification of a spatially coherent immune–epithelial interaction hub
- Enrichment of plasma cell–rich immune niches adjacent to CAF-dominated stroma
- Structured spatial organization of tumor, immune, and stromal compartments
